Thanks for stopping by! 

Here are some things you should know..

I have a passion for old Toyotas, competitive fishing, NFL analytics, flora and fauna, exploring new places, trying new foods, ecology, and mountain ranges. 

I have roots in the Blue Ridge Mountains, aspirations for the Rockies, and ancestry in the Andes. Some of my favorite places in the world are the Chickahominy River in Williamsburg, Virginia, Presque Isle Bay in Erie, Pennsylvania, Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Iquitos on the Amazon in Peru, and my home in Harpers Ferry National Park, WV. My top song of all time is Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" and my favorite book is Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World"

I aspire to one day explore the Patagonia Mountains in Argentina and fulfill my dream of catching a Golden Dorado. In the meantime, I plan to continue pursuing my passions, publishing work, and delving deeper into my education. My entrepreneurial spirit drives me to start businesses related to my interests. 
I am currently most drawn to the fields of Data Science and analytics, I am curious about how these disciplines will impact businesses' sales processes and go-to-market strategies.
